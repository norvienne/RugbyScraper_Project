- `requests` — fetching ESPN pages
- `beautifulsoup4` — parsing HTML
- `rich` — terminal UI, tables, animations
- `sqlite3` — storing standings history

---

## Clean Code Principles

- `snake_case` for functions and variables
- `CamelCase` for classes
- Small, focused functions
- DRY (no repeated code)
- Clear, meaningful names
- Good error handling

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 rich
```

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Then pick a competition from the menu:

- Press `1-7` to select a competition
- Press `r` after standings to see recent results
- Press `e` after standings to export to CSV
- Press `a` for about
- Press `q` to quit
