## Why I made this

At 15, after finishing *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin, I wanted to build something real to practice better coding. Rugby is my favourite sport, so I built a project I actually care about.

---

## Features

### v1.0
- ✅ Scrapes live rugby standings from ESPN
- ✅ Scrapes recent match results
- ✅ Clean, colourful terminal UI with animations
- ✅ Standings table with colour coded positions
- ✅ Match results display (home vs away with scores)
- ✅ Export standings to CSV
- ✅ SQLite database to store historical data
- ✅ Animated logo, banners and exit sequence
- ✅ Last updated timestamp on standings

### v2.0
- ✅ Auto-scrapes all competitions at startup
- ✅ PF, PA, PD columns — points for, against and difference
- ✅ Form column — last 5 results as coloured dots (● ● ●)
- ✅ Fixture list — upcoming matches with dates and team form
- ✅ Better results screen — winner highlighted in green with dates
- ✅ Animated team stats screen with points comparison bar chart
- ✅ Points trend graph — unlocks with daily scraping
- ✅ New result flash notifications on startup
- ✅ Smart error handling — retries, connection checks, rate limit handling
- ✅ Auto resize for narrow terminals
- ✅ Trophy 🏆 for 1st place, ⬇ for last place

### v2.1
- ✅ Full refactor — clean code pass with type hints throughout
- ✅ display.py split into 8 focused modules
- ✅ All magic numbers replaced with named constants
- ✅ Database connections use `with` statements consistently
- ✅ Zero Ruff linter warnings

### v2.2
- ✅ Async network requests — `aiohttp` instead of `requests`
- ✅ All competitions scraped concurrently at startup
- ✅ UI never freezes while waiting for ESPN
- ✅ Cross-platform terminal clearing — works on Windows and Linux
- ✅ Python logging — all errors written to `data/rugby.log`
- ✅ Docstrings on every public function
- ✅ 34 tests — stats, scraper and database all covered
- ✅ Pinned `requirements.txt`

## Clean Code Principles

- `snake_case` for functions and variables
- `CamelCase` for classes
- Small, focused functions with single responsibilities
- DRY — no repeated code
- Clear, meaningful names
- Type hints on every function
- Docstrings on every public function
- Logging module instead of print statements
- Graceful error handling throughout
- Zero linter warnings
- 34 tests covering core logic

---

## Installation
```bash
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4 rich
```

Or with a virtual environment (recommended on Linux):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate.fish  # fish shell
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4 rich
```

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```

Then pick a competition from the menu:

- Press `1-7` to select a competition
- Press `r` after standings to see recent results
- Press `f` after standings to see upcoming fixtures
- Press `t` after standings to see team stats and graph
- Press `e` after standings to export to CSV
- Press `a` for about
- Press `q` to quit
