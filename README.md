## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- `requests` — fetching ESPN pages
- `beautifulsoup4` — parsing HTML
- `rich` — terminal UI, tables, animations
- `sqlite3` — storing standings and match history

---

## Project Structure
```
RugbyScraper/
├── main.py          — entry point, handles user input
├── scraper.py       — fetches and parses ESPN data
├── display.py       — all terminal UI and animations
├── database.py      — SQLite database operations
├── competitions.py  — competition URLs and config
├── exporter.py      — CSV export
├── stats.py         — team history and form data
└── data/
    ├── rugby.db     — SQLite database
    └── exports/     — exported CSV files
```

---

## Clean Code Principles

- `snake_case` for functions and variables
- `CamelCase` for classes
- Small, focused functions with single responsibilities
- DRY — no repeated code
- Clear, meaningful names
- Docstrings on every function
- Graceful error handling throughout

---

## Installation
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 rich
```

Or with a virtual environment (recommended on Linux):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate.fish  # fish shell
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 rich
```

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```

Then pick a competition from the menu:

- Press `1-7` to select a competition
- Press `r` after standings to see recent results
- Press `f` after standings to see upcoming fixtures
- Press `t` after standings to see team stats and graph
- Press `e` after standings to export to CSV
- Press `a` for about
- Press `q` to quit
