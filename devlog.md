I missed 3 days because i broke my foot while playing rugby somehow 
Started the scraper today. First try got a 403 error from ESPN.
Fixed it by adding browser headers so ESPN thinks we are a real browser
Feels good that the error made sense and i knew how to fix it
Parsing finally works after fighting ESPN's split table layout like wtf who even uses ts  
also had to find the stats table manually by checking classes. France top of 
Six Nations with 15 points, Wales bottom with 1 even tho its real data it was hard to get i spent like 3hr on it :(

Soooo im home today due to my leg so im going to add more stuff than i usually do
Ok so rn i finished the scrapper.py where i added one of the most important parts function called parse_standings() it is made to get team data from ESPN HTML page bro but it took me like 4 hours somehow cuz i was refactoring code but omg it takes so long 
omggg i finally got database working , it was so hard like fr like i had to add UNIQUE to team name , and also fix competitions insert 
also sort out import list like wtffff thats too hard
six nations standings are now properly saved to db!
added a really cool logo animation
also i added really cool choosing of competition thing
i also added a coloured table while watching wales vs ireland game 
this day i ahd loads of progress and i think it is really good

OK SO THIS 2 WEEKS WAS MASSIVE like actually insane progress
First had loads of setup issues - pip wasnt working on CachyOS cuz of the 
externally managed environment thing had to use venv which was also a pain
but got there in the end

So v2.0 is fully done today here is what i built:

SCRAPER IMPROVEMENTS
- Added PF, PA, PD columns (points for, against, difference) to standings
- Fixed the scraper to grab these from the right ESPN cell indices
- Added proper error handling with 3 retries, specific messages for 403/404/429/500
- Added ESPN connectivity check at startup
- Auto-scrapes ALL competitions when you launch the app now
- Match results now saved to the database properly
- Fixed date scraping - was using wrong CSS class (ScoreboardScoreCell__Time 
  vs ScoreCell__Time) took a quick HTML inspection to find it

NEW FEATURES
- Fixture list with dates and team form (f key)
- Form data scraped directly from ESPN HTML (WWLWL format)
- Better results screen - winner highlighted green, dates shown
- Animated team stats screen with growing bar chart
- Points comparison chart showing all teams at once
- New result FLASH notifications on startup - flashes each new result 
  one by one with animation, compares db before/after scrape
- Points trend graph (unlocks after running daily for a few days)
- Trophy for 1st place, down arrow for last
- Auto resize for narrow terminals - hides PF/PA/PD columns if too small
- Fixed description panel text wrapping

Also updated the README with all v2.0 features and pushed everything to GitHub
Tagged as v2.0 on main branch

Coded for like 3hrs straight every single day of the week also made pivate repo because almost broke this one, loads of debugging but everything works
The notification animation is probably my favourite thing ive built so far
Exams soon so might slow down but v2 is done and im happy with it :)

Big refactor today — split display.py into 8 proper modules
Fixed magic numbers, type hints, with() for db connections
Friend helped catch a redundant check in get_team_form
Ruff linter now clean, tagged v2.1

----------------------------------------

MASSIVE day today - basically rewrote half the project

v2.1 - big refactor pass with help from a friend who knows his stuff
- split display.py into 8 proper modules (constants, utils, animations, 
  menu, standings, team_stats, results, notifications)
- all magic numbers replaced with named constants
- type hints on every single function
- with() statements for all db connections
- friend caught duplicate result style functions - merged into one
- friend caught redundant check in get_team_form
- friend caught os.system("clear") deprecation - fixed with platform.system()
- zero Ruff linter warnings
- tagged v2.1

v2.2 - async rewrite + tests + logging
- switched from requests to aiohttp for async network requests
- all competitions now scraped CONCURRENTLY at startup
- proof: 1 competition = 0.58s, all 4 = 3.22s (not 4x0.58 sequential)
- added Python logging module - all errors/warnings go to data/rugby.log
- added docstrings to every public function across all files
- wrote 34 tests covering stats, scraper parsing and database operations
- 34/34 passing
- pinned requirements.txt, removed unused requests library
- empty input on menu no longer crashes with "invalid choice"
- tagged v2.2

Coded for like 8hrs today ngl - exams soon but this was worth it
Project is genuinely clean now and i actually understand why
